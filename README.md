**Introduction**  
  
Welcome to our innovative web scraping project focused on gathering real-time data about houses for sale in the Greater Toronto Area and its neighboring area from Kijiji.ca website. In a dynamic real estate market like the GTA, staying informed about property listings, prices, and trends is crucial for both potential homebuyers and investors. Leveraging the power of web scraping, our project aims to collect and analyze comprehensive information from various online sources, providing users with an up-to-date and consolidated view of the available properties. By automating the data collection process, we aim to offer a user-friendly platform that simplifies the house-hunting journey and empowers individuals to make well-informed real estate decisions.
